# ROADMAP — QA Process Orchestration

> Single source of truth for **what we build next and how we track it**. Each item names where it

> PR/commit that ships the change.

> [`core`](packages/core) · [`claude-qa-orchestrator`](packages/claude-qa-orchestrator) ·

## How to use this file

- **Status legend:** `✅ shipped` · `🚧 in progress` · `⬜ planned` · `🧊 backlog (unscheduled)`.
- Every roadmap item has a stable **ID** (`R-###`). Reference it in commits (`feat(R-004): …`) and tests.
- A change is *done* when: code + tests (incl. the parity test) pass, this file flips the item to ✅
  with the version + commit, and the linked PRD/TECH section is updated.
- The shared **`@qa-orch/core`** holds all platform-agnostic logic; both packages must stay at **parity**
  (enforced by `packages/core/tests/scaffold.test.ts`). New skills/MCP wiring land in `core`, never in a leaf.
- Releases are **per package, independently versioned** (`packages/*/package.json`); `core` is private and
  bundled. Bump on each shipped item.

| 0.9.0 | **R-019** `qa-reverse-engineer` skill + `context/reference/` — reverse-engineers app source into structured project docs (business, architecture, data flow, integrations, entry points, test surface); proposes a split for monoliths first | `0883c46` | `model/skills.ts`, `model/context.ts`, `tests/scaffold.test.ts`, `PRD.md`, `TECH.md`, READMEs |

| 0.16.0 | **R-026** Guideline-standard upgrade — every guideline now carries a mandatory `## Examples (✅ good / ❌ bad)` section + an encouraged `## Applicable patterns` section (phase-2 `*_PATTERNS` slots); `doctor` enforces the good/bad examples (`GUIDELINE:examples:<name>`, error); TECH §12.1 documents the rule | `8851a91` | `model/context.ts` (`GUIDELINES`), `doctor/index.ts`, `tests/scaffold.test.ts`, `tests/doctor.test.ts`, `TECH.md` §12.1 |
| 0.17.0 | **R-027** `qa-ci-pipeline` skill (write) — generates or audits a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Azure Pipelines) that runs `{{AUTOMATION_FRAMEWORK}}`, fails on test failure, and publishes the result dirs wired into the result MCP (Playwright/pytest/Surefire-Serenity/Allure); wired from `qa-test-automate` + `qa-automation-bootstrapper` `## Next`; closes the test → report → legibility loop at the CI boundary | `72ea232` | `model/skills.ts`, `tests/scaffold.test.ts`, `PRD.md` §5, `TECH.md` §5, `ROADMAP.md` |
| 0.18.0 | **R-028** `documentation-as-code` guideline + `doctor` enforcement — codifies what the product embodies (docs versioned in-repo, reviewed in PR, validated by `doctor`, synced via CI per R-027); ships on both platforms via `GUIDELINES` (with ✅/❌ examples + `DOCS_AS_CODE_PATTERNS`/`PROJECT_DOC_WORKFLOW` phase-2 slots); `doctor` adds a content-contract check (`DOCASCODE:contract`, error) parallel to the iron-QA-rule check | `49b2881` | `model/context.ts` (`GUIDELINES`), `doctor/index.ts`, `tests/scaffold.test.ts`, `tests/doctor.test.ts`, `TECH.md` §12.1, `PRD.md` §8 |

PRD capabilities §5 and the harness-engineering roadmap in PRD §8 / TECH §11 track these at the product level.

> `R-007` (verified). IDs are **append-only and never reused**, so `R-007` stays a permanent gap
> (reserved/skipped), not a slot to fill. The current shipped suite is **20 skills** (the 13 of R-001,

> `qa-coverage-gap` from R-022, `qa-metrics` from R-012, `qa-playwright-cli` from R-024, and

_All scheduled items are shipped: R-013/R-014/R-015/R-017 in **v0.8.0**, R-018/R-019/R-020/R-021
(two new skills, `## Next` orchestration, `qa-gardening` sharpening) in **v0.9.0**, R-022
(`qa-coverage-gap`) in **v0.10.0**, R-010 (richer test-data factories) in **v0.11.0**, R-012
(`qa-metrics` + Allure observability) in **v0.12.0**, R-023 (Playwright browser MCP) in **v0.13.0**, and
R-024 (`qa-playwright-cli`) in **v0.14.0**, R-025 (Mermaid diagram standard) in **v0.15.0**, and R-026

in **v0.17.0**, and R-028 (`documentation-as-code` guideline + `doctor` enforcement) in **v0.18.0**. The
next stack/feature work lives in the backlog below._

## Backlog (unscheduled)

- **🧊 R-029 — Anti-Hallucination (grounding) rule.** A load-bearing rule in the lean root config (so
  it survives compaction) plus a guideline: every skill grounds claims in real artifacts (file:line,
  ticket IDs, result-MCP output), cites its sources, and explicitly flags uncertainty instead of
  inventing facts/paths/APIs. Lands: `model/context.ts` (root config + `GUIDELINES`),
  `model/skills.ts` (procedure preambles), `doctor/index.ts`, TECH §11. **Done when:** the rule is in
  the root config and a guideline, referenced by skill procedures, and `doctor` checks its presence;
  parity green. Traces: TECH §11 (harness engineering).

- **🧊 R-030 — Documentation-Driven / Spec-Driven Development guideline.** Codify spec-first flow: a
  documented spec / acceptance criteria precede case design, automation and code; every test traces
  back to the spec (extends the iron QA rule from the authoring direction). Lands:
  `model/context.ts` (`GUIDELINES`), `model/skills.ts` (`## Next` wiring, e.g. `qa-ticket-review` →
  `qa-test-case-design`), TECH §12. **Done when:** the guideline ships on both platforms, the skill
  flow references it, parity green. Traces: PRD §5, TECH §11/§12.

- **🧊 R-031 — Auto-fix broken relative links (`doctor --fix`), incl. Playwright report/trace links.**
  Extend `doctor` from detect-only to optional, deterministic repair of broken relative links in
  `context/` (reusing the auditskill `apply-step` dry-run/write pattern), explicitly handling
  Playwright report/trace paths surfaced by `qa-playwright-cli` / the Playwright result MCP. Lands:
  `doctor/index.ts`, `cli.ts`, `tests/`. **Done when:** `doctor --fix` repairs known broken-link
  classes (dry-run by default), leaves unfixable links as findings, and tests cover both paths.
  Traces: TECH §11 ("mechanical enforcement + remediation-carrying errors").

- **🧊 R-032 — C4 (4-level) architecture-documentation standard.** Adopt the C4 model (L1 Context →
  L2 Container → L3 Component → L4 Code) as the architecture-doc standard for `context/reference/`
  produced by `qa-reverse-engineer` (R-019), rendered through the Mermaid `diagram-conventions`
  guideline (R-025). Lands: `model/context.ts` (`GUIDELINES` + reference templates),
  `model/skills.ts` (`qa-reverse-engineer`), TECH §12. **Done when:** reverse-engineer emits
  C4-structured architecture docs, `diagram-conventions` maps each C4 level to a diagram type, parity
  green. Traces: R-019, R-025, TECH §12.

- **🧊 R-033 — "Review related guidelines before work" rule.** A standing procedural rule in the lean
  root config: every write skill's first step is to read all related guidelines/standards before
  acting (composes with R-029 grounding and R-028 docs-as-code). Lands: `model/context.ts` (root
  config), `model/skills.ts` (procedure preambles), `doctor/index.ts` (optional check), TECH §11.
  **Done when:** the rule is in the root config, write-skill procedures open with a "read related
  guidelines" step, parity green. Traces: TECH §11.

> **ID notes — R-011 dropped, R-016 merged.** `R-011` (k6 / performance) was removed from the backlog
> as deprioritized; `R-016` (richer observability) was folded into **R-012**. IDs are append-only and
> never reused, so both stay permanent gaps (like R-007), not slots to fill.

## Conventions for tracking

- One PR/commit per `R-###` where practical; commit subject `type(R-###): summary`.
- On ship: flip status to ✅, add a row to **Shipped** with version + commit, bump the package version(s),
  and update the linked PRD/TECH section. Keep `qa-gardening` itself honest — run `doctor` before shipping.
- Keep this list pruned: move stale ideas to backlog, delete dead ones.
